# Faraphel

Welcome to my Github page!

I am a French developper who love programming projects about some games like [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) 
or [Mario Kart Wii](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_Wii), but also some useful stuff here and there.

My main programming languages are [Python](https://www.python.org/) for the flexibility and portability, 
and [C++](https://cplusplus.com/) for the control and speed.

My biggest project yet is my mod [Mario Kart Wii Atlas](https://www.faraphel.fr/atlas/) that add thousands of tracks to 
the base Mario Kart Wii game based on the community votes, combined with its installer allowing for a big customisability.
