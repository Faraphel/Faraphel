Welcome to my Github page!

I am a French developper who love programming projects about some games like [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) 
or [Mario Kart Wii](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_Wii), but also some useful stuff here and there.

My biggest project yet is my mod [Mario Kart Wii Atlas](https://www.faraphel.fr/atlas/) that add thousands of tracks to 
the base Mario Kart Wii game based on the community votes, combined with its installer allowing for a big customisability.

Most of my projects here are mirror of my own forgejo instance. You can find the original ones here : 
- Personal Projects : https://git.faraphel.fr/faraphel
- Atlas (Mario Kart Wii mod) : https://git.faraphel.fr/Atlas

My main programming languages are [Python](https://www.python.org/) for the flexibility and portability, 
and [C++](https://cplusplus.com/) for the control and speed.

Here is my language tierlist :
- Python ðŸ’Œ - Flexibility and portability
- C++ ðŸ’Œ - Speed and control over the machine
- C ðŸ˜„ - Same as C++, but I miss my class, template and standard functions
- Kotlin ðŸ˜„ - So much more concise and readable than Java
- AngelScript ðŸ˜„ - So much control on the engine
- Lua ðŸ˜„ - Great, but is missing some standard functions
- TypeScript ðŸ˜„ - So much more intuitive and readable than JavaScript
- JavaScript ðŸ¤” - So much less intuitive and readable than TypeScript
- Java ðŸ¤” - Way too verbose and slow
- ASM PPC ðŸ¤” - If only you had a clear MOV instruction instead of an empty ADD
- VBS ðŸ¤” - Better than VBA, but still have many flaws
- ASM 68k ðŸ’€ - How can half of the memory address be innacessible directly ?
- PHP ðŸ’€ - Hard to read, slow and require too much attention to security that could be automatic 
- VBA ðŸ‘¹ - THERE IS NO "WITH BLOCK", HOW IS THAT RELATED TO A MISSING "SET" BEFORE A REFERENCE ???
